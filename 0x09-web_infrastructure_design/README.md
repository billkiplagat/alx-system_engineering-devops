# How the web works
1. User Input: The process starts when the user enters a website's domain name (e.g., www.example.com) into their web browser's address bar and presses Enter.

2. DNS Resolution: The browser sends a request to a DNS server to translate the domain name into an IP address. The DNS server responds with the IP address of the web server hosting the requested website (e.g., 192.168.1.1).

3. HTTP Request: The browser uses the IP address to send an HTTP request to the web server at that address, asking for the web page associated with the domain.

4. Server Processing: The web server receives the request and processes it. It may generate the requested web page dynamically, interact with application servers or databases, and assemble the final content.

5. HTTP Response: The web server sends back an HTTP response containing the requested web page (HTML, images, scripts, etc.) to the user's browser.

6. Browser Rendering: The user's browser receives the response and begins rendering the web page. It parses the HTML, fetches additional resources (like images and scripts), and constructs the visual representation of the page.

7. Display on Screen: The browser displays the fully rendered web page on the user's screen, making it accessible for interaction.
