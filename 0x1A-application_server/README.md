# Application server

* `Gunicorn`, which stands for "Green Unicorn," is a popular WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) HTTP server for running Python web applications. It is designed to be a production-ready server that is simple to use and can handle a large number of concurrent requests efficiently.

* `proxy_pass` is a directive in Nginx configuration that is used to pass client requests to a specified backend server. It is commonly used in the context of reverse proxy setups, where Nginx acts as an intermediary between clients (users or other servers) and a backend server that actually processes the requests.
